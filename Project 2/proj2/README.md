# Project 2 ➕ — Polynomial Linked List

## Overview
This project implements a `Polynomial` class using a chain of linked nodes.  
It supports constructing polynomials from file input, printing them, copying, and adding polynomials while combining like terms.

## Features
- `Node` class stores exponent, coefficient, and next link.  
- `Polynomial` class supports:  
  - Construction from string input.  
  - Deep copy constructor.  
  - Printing polynomials.  
  - Static `add()` method to sum two polynomials and combine like terms.  
- User can iteratively add polynomials from a list until exit.

## Sample Runs
