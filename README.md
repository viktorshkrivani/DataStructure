# Data Structures & Algorithms Projects

This repository contains 4 programming projects for CIS 2353 that explore core data structure and algorithm concepts.

## Table of Contents

- [Project 1 🍕 — Pizza Class (Comparable & Enums)](./Project%201/Proj1/README.md) 
  Build a `Pizza` class with enums for crust and size, toppings stored in an ArrayList, and implement `toString`, `equals`, and `compareTo` for comparison.

- [Project 2 ➕ — Polynomial Linked List](./Project%202/proj2/README.md)  
  Implement a `Polynomial` class using a linked chain of nodes, supporting printing, deep copy, and polynomial addition with like-term combination.

- [Project 3 📚 — ChangeStack (Custom Stack with Modifiers)](./Project%203/proj3/README.md)  
  Create a stack-like structure with push/pop plus custom `increaseValues` and `decreaseValues` operations, throwing exceptions for empty stacks.

- [Project 4 🏥 — Triage Simulator with Priority Queues](./Project%204/proj4/README.md)  
  Simulate a hospital triage system by parsing patients from file into three priority queues, always serving the most urgent cases first.
